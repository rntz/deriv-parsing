dparse-orig.rkt and dparse.rkt are rewrites of Matt Mights' dparse.rkt, which
you can find here:
http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/code/dparse.rkt

Matt Might has released it under the CRAPL:
http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/

I guess that means my modifications to it are CRAPLed too? Honestly I don't know
much about licensing.

My own stuff (everything else) is licensed under the WTFPL. If you wanna use
it, just go ahead. Don't be an asshole (that's not legally binding).

You can find the contents of the CRAPL & WTFPL licenses in the correspondingly
named files.
